[master.c GENERAL DESCRIPTION]

This process has two main roles, it executes the other executables 
using the system call fork(), and it insures the communication 
between them onces running.

At the beginning of execution, master creates a logfile whose name 
is passed as arguments to all children for a centralised logging.
It then executes display and cmd_shell in two separate konsole 
windows while executing motor1, motor2 and watchdog in the background.

During execution, master handles signals and communication. When one 
process recieve a signal, it sends a message to master, which can in 
return send appropriate signals to the other processes.
